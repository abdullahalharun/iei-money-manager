## Development Setup

See the [README.md](README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/abdullahalharun/iei-money-manager.git

pnpm install

# Start development servers
cd infra && docker-compose up -d

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Always use TypeScript for new code
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use strict mode enabled in tsconfig

### Validation

- All user input must be validated using **Zod schemas**
- Validation schemas go in `<module>.validation.ts`
- Never trust client-side validation alone

### Module Pattern

Follow the established module pattern:

```
<module>/
â”œâ”€â”€ <module>.controller.ts    # Express route handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ <module>.service.ts       # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ <module>.route.ts         # Route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ <module>.types.ts         # TypeScript types
â””â”€â”€ <module>.validation.ts    # Zod schemas
```

### Git Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat(accounts): add account balance validation
fix(transactions): correct date filtering bug
docs: update setup instructions
```

### Code Formatting

- We use Prettier for code formatting
- Run `pnpm format` before committing
- Format on save is recommended in your editor

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Aim for good coverage but focus on critical paths
- Mock external dependencies
